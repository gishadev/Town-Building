# Town Building
 
I like city building games, based on isometric view, so in this prototype I tried to replicate main mechanic of those games. You can build a small medieval town like I did.

Nothing special, but I see a potential in this simple system.

## What I Learned
* Creating a grid-based building system
* Setting up a controllable isometric camera
* Creating Toon custom lighting in ASE

## Controls
* W,A,S,D / Press and Drag LMB - Camera Movement
* Q,E / Press and Drag Mouse Wheel - Camera Rotation
* RMB - Build/Destroy
